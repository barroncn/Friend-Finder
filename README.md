Friend Finder App

[Check it out here!](https://stark-atoll-94774.herokuapp.com/)

This was my first app using a Node server! User's take a survey, and based on similarity of answers, they are matched with someone from the "database" (for this app it is simply a JSON file that has five prepopulated users and then holds new users per session). 

Technologies Used: 

Node.js | Express.js | Bootstrap | JavaScript | jQuery | Heroku
